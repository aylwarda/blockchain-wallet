# blockchain-wallet
This repository contains python-based code which creates and manages a crypto wallet. The wallet supports both BTC and ETH-based addresses.  I will show some test transactions and run through some steps demonstrating this ... continue reading.

# Py-thollet
Silly title, but explains what I've built :) ... a Python Crypto Wallet! Yee ha!

## Intro
What follows is partly a demonstration and set of instructions for you to do the same.

### Wallet Setup
As part of this project, I use hd-wallet-derive.  What is it?  Well, from dan-da's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive), "hd-wallet-derive is a command-line tool that derives bip32 addresses and private keys for Bitcoin and many altcoins."  
It is very easy to use, but requires that PHP is installed.  There are other versions of it and perhaps you'd prefer to use those, e.g. JavaScript, Go, etc.; find them on the web.

Here I will write a short description about what the wallet does, what it's built with, and how to use it.

As an example:

./hd-wallet-derive.php --help-coins

## Transaction Demos

### NOTES section

- Include installing pip dependencies
- Include cloning and installing hd-wallet-derive
